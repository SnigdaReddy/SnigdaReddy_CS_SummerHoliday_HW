    <h1>Climate Change Awarenss</h1>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term <br> shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. <br>
        Many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting<br>
        in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more <br>
        frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and <br>
        glaciers have also experienced changesâ€”oceans are warming<br>
        and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea<br>
        level is rising.</p>

    <h2>The causes and impacts of climate change</h2>
    <p>The ocean level is rising, glaciers are melting, <br>
        CO2 in the air is increasing, forest and wildlife <br>
        are declining, and water life is also getting disturbed.<br>
        --- EFFECTS<br>
        Burning fossil fuels, deforestation<br>
        --- CAUSES</p>

    <h2>The solutions of climate change</h2>
    <p>Changing our main energy sources to clean and<br>
        renewable energyis the best way to stop using fossil fuels.<br>
        These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and<br>
        geothermal power. Switch to sustainable transport. Petrol and<br>
        diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels.<br> <br> <br>
        Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas-and the more that are
        extracted <br> and burned, the worse climate change will get. All
        countries need to <br> move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>The ways individuals can take action to address climate change</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save energy at home</li>
        <li>Walk, bike, or take public transport</li>
        <li>Eat more vegetables</li>
        <li>Throw away less food</li>
        <li>Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle</li>
        <li>Change your home's source of energy</li>
        <li>Switch to an electric vehicle</li>
    </ul>
